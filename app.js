    prompt: `Sign-Off & Family To-Do Generator
Generate two components: 3 personalized sign-off options and a family to-do list.

PART 1: PERSONALIZED SIGN-OFFS
Create 3 brief, warm sign-off options matching visit context.
Structure: [Personal touch/acknowledgment], [well-wish or next step]. [Closing]
Guidelines:
·	Warm and genuine, never formulaic
·	Acknowledge something specific when possible
·	Match emotional tone to visit type
·	Keep <=25 words total
·	Balance professional with personable
·	Reference activities, interests, milestones if mentioned
·	For difficult visits: acknowledge courage, effort, or partnership
Visit-Specific Approaches:
Well visits/milestones: Celebrate growth, reference developmental milestones Sick visits: Empathize, offer comfort suggestion, reassure about calling Chronic conditions: Acknowledge effort, emphasize partnership Behavioral/mental health: Acknowledge courage, normalize seeking help Complex/concerning: Name plan clearly, offer availability Referrals: Acknowledge next step, reassure continuity
Examples:
5yo female well visit, starting kindergarten, plays soccer:
Great seeing y'all today! Good luck with soccer and kindergarten! Excited for you!
She is going to do great in kindergarten. Can't wait to hear about it next visit!
What an exciting year ahead! We're here if you need anything.
Male, Viral laryngitis, strep pending, difficult hydrating:
Drink lots of fluids! Popsicles are my favorite when sick. Call if not improving.
Hope he feels better soon. Those popsicles should help. We'll call with results tomorrow.
It is hard when they feel so crummy. Keep offering fluids and call if he's not gettting better. We're here!
Female, New ADHD diagnosis, parent emotional, starting medication:
It takes courage to have this conversation-thank you for advocating for her! We're here to support you.
You're doing the right thing getting her help. We'll partner with you every step. Call anytime.
A new diagnosis can feel overwhelming, but we'll take it step by step. We're here for you.
Male, Asthma exacerbation, previous PICU admission, pulmonology referral:
We'll get him to Pulmonology to help get on top of all of this. Call if anything changes-we're here.
It is scary navigating all of this after your experiences. The specialist will help us care for him. Please call with any concerns.
You're doing everything right seeking care early. Don't hesitate to reach out.
Key Elements to Extract: Patient name, activities/hobbies, school transitions, specific treatments, emotional tone, referrals, chronic conditions, parent effort, family context
Output:
{Personalized sign off specific to visit}
{Personalizes sign off emphasizing relationship}
{Personalized sign off forward-looking/supportive}

PART 2: FAMILY TO-DO LIST
Extract actionable items into simple checklist. Include only concrete next steps with essential details.
Format:
Your To-Do List:
Prescriptions:
·	[If none: omit "No new prescriptions today."]
Tests/Results:
·	[Test]: Results pending, we will call [timeframe] [If none: omit section]
Appointments:
·	Schedule [specialty] appointment
·	Return to clinic in [timeframe] [If none: "No appointments to schedule today."]

Rules:
1.	Simple dashes for bullets
2.	One item per line, <=12 words
3.	Only items requiring family action
4.	Be specific about timeframes
5.	Bold section headers
6.	No explanations, just actions
7.	Extract from note only
8.  Indent all bullets with 8 spaces followed by simple dash
Examples:
Viral laryngitis, strep pending, acetaminophen, follow up 7 days if no improvement:
Your To-Do List:
Tests/Results:
·	Strep test: Results pending, we will call tomorrow
Appointments:
·	Return to clinic if no improvement in 7 days
Asthma exacerbation, Flovent and albuterol started, pulmonology referral, 3-month follow-up:
Your To-Do List:
Prescriptions:
·	Flovent with spacer
·	Albuterol inhaler as needed for wheezing/coughing
Appointments:
·	Schedule Pulmonology appointment
·	Return to clinic in 3 months for asthma check
Include: All new/changed prescriptions, pending test results, referrals needing scheduling, specific return timeframes, concrete action items
Exclude: General advice (fluids, rest), warning signs, explanations, background info

MDM Component Assessment
A. PROBLEMS ADDRESSED
·   Straightforward: 1 self-limited/minor problem
·   Low: 2+ self-limited/minor problems OR 1 stable chronic illness OR 1 acute uncomplicated illness
·   Moderate: Chronic illness with exacerbation/progression OR 2+ stable chronic illnesses OR undiagnosed new problem OR acute illness with systemic symptoms OR acute complicated injury
·   High: Chronic illness with severe exacerbation OR illness posing threat to life/bodily function
B. DATA COMPLEXITY
·   Low: Assessment requires independent historian, None or one piece of data reviewed/ordered along with
·   Moderate: Any combination of two tests ordered, test results reviewed, or prior external notes reviewed along with assessment requiring an independent historian
·   High: Meets criteria for Moderate AND discussion with external physician regarding interpretation of tests OR independent test interpretation
C. RISK LEVEL
·   Minimal: Minimal risk from testing/treatment
·   Low: OTC medications, rest, observation
·   Moderate: Prescription drugs, Dx or Rx limited by social factors
·   High: Decision regarding hospitalization
2-of-3 Rule
Overall MDM = level met by at least 2 of 3 components.
·   Straightforward = 99212
·   Low = 99213
·   Moderate = 99214
·   High = 99215
Modifier 25 Check
Add modifier 25 for a separately identifiable E/M service during a Well Child Check/Routine child health examination.
Output Format
Problems: [Level] [Brief explanation]
Data: [Level] [What was reviewed/ordered]
Risk: [Level] [Treatment risk level and why]
MDM Score: Problems ([Level]) + Data ([Level]) + Risk ([Level]) = [Overall Level] (based on 2 of 3)
Final Code: 99XXX
Modifier 25 Format:
Modifier 25: Well visit with separate E/M for:
 - [Problem 1] ([brief intervention])
 - [Problem 2] ([brief intervention])
Critical Coding Rules
1. Ordering any culture (e.g., strep, urine) implies consideration of prescription management and elevates Risk to at least Moderate.
2. Acute illness with systemic symptoms + any culture ordered = 99214 (Moderate Problems + Moderate Data + Moderate Risk).
3. Assume Assessment requiring an independent historian is always true.
Examples
Viral URI (simple) Runny nose, cough. Exam: clear. Plan: supportive care.
Problems: Low (1 acute uncomplicated) Data: Minimal Risk: Low (supportive care only) MDM Score: Problems (Low) + Data (Minimal) + Risk (Low) = Straightforward (based on 2 of 3) Final Code: 99212
Strep Throat Sore throat, fever 102F, body aches. Exam: exudates. Plan: strep test, amox if positive.
Problems: Moderate (Acute illness with systemic symptoms) Data: Moderate (test ordered) Risk: Moderate (prescription antibiotic) MDM Score: Problems (Moderate) + Data (Moderate) + Risk (Moderate) = Moderate (based on 2 of 3) Final Code: 99214
UTI with Fever Toddler with fever 102.5, crying with urination. Exam: suprapubic tenderness. Urine dipstick positive. Plan: send urine culture.
Problems: Moderate (acute illness with systemic symptoms) Data: Moderate (2 tests ordered and independent historian) Risk: Moderate (culture implies potential prescription) MDM Score: Problems (Moderate) + Data (Moderate) + Risk (Moderate) = Moderate (based on 2 of 3) Final Code: 99214
Well Visit + Ear Infection 5yo well child check. Parent reports ear pain, fever x2 days. Exam: acute otitis media. Plan: amoxicillin.
Problems: Low (1 acute uncomplicated) Data: Minimal Risk: Moderate (prescription) MDM Score: Problems (Low) + Data (Minimal) + Risk (Moderate) = Low (based on 2 of 3) Final Code: 99393 + 99213-25 Modifier 25: Well visit with separate E/M for: - Acute otitis media (amoxicillin)
Well Visit + Multiple Issues 18-month well child check. Also has URI and diaper rash. Exam: clear rhinorrhea, diaper dermatitis. Plan: supportive care for URI, barrier cream for rash.
Problems: Low (2 self-limited problems: URI, diaper rash) Data: Minimal Risk: Low (OTC/supportive care) MDM Score: Problems (Low) + Data (Minimal) + Risk (Low) = Low (based on 2 of 3) Final Code: 99392 + 99213-25 Modifier 25: Well visit with separate E/M for: - Viral URI (supportive care) - Diaper rash (barrier cream)
Asthma Exacerbation, using albuterol 4-5x/day, night cough. Exam: mild wheezing. Plan: increase Flovent.
Problems: Moderate (chronic with exacerbation) Data: Minimal Risk: Moderate (prescription adjustment) MDM Score: Problems (Moderate) + Data (Minimal) + Risk (Moderate) = Moderate (based on 2 of 3) Final Code: 99214
Multiple Minor Issues Viral URI, diaper rash, small bruise. Exam unremarkable. Plan: supportive care, barrier cream, observation.
Problems: Low (3 self-limited problems) Data: Minimal Risk: Low (OTC only) MDM Score: Problems (Low) + Data (Minimal) + Risk (Low) = Straightforward (based on 2 of 3) Final Code: 99212
